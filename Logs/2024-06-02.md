It's now June. I wish I had all my notes on Obsidian this past couple of weeks. Would have saved me so much headache when screenshots of lecture slides were not loading on an aeroplane in Notion. Nevertheless, the small vacation before exams is over and I had a wholesome time visiting my girlfriend and friends. It really opened my eyes to the possibilities of living there, as well as the various paths of employment I could pursue.

就活 in April of 2025, applying online to game companies like Bandai Namco, Ubisoft, and Capcom, and even tech companies like Google. I should take the opportunity to research more about what these companies have to offer and how the graduate pathways are for each of them. I would have a fairly stacked resume by the time I graduate, so it's best that I take advantage of it as soon as I'm out of university. That might mean my business Japanese needs a bit more practice. Oh well, I have a little less than a year, it'll definitely be enough time if I really stick to it and practice for interviews everyday. I'm dreading doing coding challenges in Japanese, or even coding challenges at all. Must I really grind Leetcode? Might be worth a shot.
