Quite a few days have passed since the last log and it feels much longer than just a few days. I went to Kyoto University's November Festival, had an amazing date at 嵐山, went to 清水寺 for the 紅葉 illuminations, and watched the last Kansai university league rugby game for Kyoto University.

All in all, I feel really lucky to be here and to have met the people that I have met. I don't want to neglect any part of my life, but I feel like my health may be taking a backseat to everything else, sleeping too late or eating too unhealthily.

It's always nice to have a balance in everything in life. I'll find it, just not now when I don't have much time.
