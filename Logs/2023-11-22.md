I don't feel like writing about tasks done. Everything at work is pretty meaningless with the clients putting more effort into minor aspects of the game as opposed to making the game more fun. It's such a waste of talent, time, and effort. It's so sad to say that the game I'll be working on is not going to be successful in the first place.

Not only that, I don't even know when I'll be able to work on a proper game. I don't even know if I'll be able to do it myself. All I have to do is trust that life will point me in the right direction.

On a brighter side, I finally went on a 神社 date to see the 紅葉 under illumination. It was absolutely beautiful and I'm glad we went to a smaller temple as opposed to 清水寺. We had quiet time together and came back to sleep the day away. When I die, it'll be the relationships and impact I made on others, not about the amount of money I make or the people I impress.
