Today's the last day of the family trip until I can get home tomorrow. I really can't wait for this to be over. I was meaning to talk to my family a bit more, but I got sick and had to spend today resting. I only went out 3 days out of 7, which is a waste I guess, but I really don't care at this point. If I'm not mentally up for it, why bother? I just feel like this has been an absurd waste of my time and energy and that I need to spent the next month training hard to get back to my previous physical state.

At this point too, I just need a hug.
