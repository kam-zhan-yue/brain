These logs are not daily, they haven't been for a while, but maybe it's better like that. I wonder if I said something like this before. Anyways, it has been a seriously hectic weekend, I participated in a rugby match, made lots of progress on Chaos Pong, and got to hang out with Wato a bunch.

Time is passing too fast though, I feel like I've settled into a routine which I really don't want to. I wanna keep doing things that push me to the limit because if I let this time pass without thinking much of it, I will regret it for sure. 

I should probably learn more Spanish soon though... Duolingo is really not enough.
