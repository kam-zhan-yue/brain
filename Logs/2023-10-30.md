* Brainstormed art direction of Chaos Pong

# Reflection
Exercise does great things for the mind. I brainstormed a lot about Chaos Pong a day before (but forgot to write about it). I was hoping to adopt a 3D game design with 2D graphics, using Billboard sprites to achieve depth. As the player goes closer and further away, the size of their sprite decreases and increases respectively. As the ping pong ball moves closer, it gets larger, and vice-versa. I think this will create a unique aesthetic to the game that prevents it from being seen as another generic 3D low-poly sports game.

At work, it seems like scriptable objects are weirder than I thought. I assumed all my UI would be using a singular scriptable object reference, UIConnector, but it seems like multiple references of my UIConnector was created. I can only assumed this was due to asset serialisation creating multiple asset files of that scriptable object. Hence, I relied too heavily on my connector as a UI controller, which was not its intended purpose, and was burned by bugs that were build-specific.

The answer, however, was exceedingly simple. Just abstract the controller code into more scriptable objects. Since they only point to references, there would only be one of each data object. Hence, all roads lead back to the same destination. Sure, there can be multiple UIConnectors, but they are just connectors. Let them connect. As long as they get to their destination.

The tomato sucks. I wish the workflow was better. Loading takes 1-2 minutes, so I watch videos in between script compilations. I want to drop Unity and heavy game engines to work faster, quicker, and more streamlined. I don't need large features if I want to just make small-scale games.
