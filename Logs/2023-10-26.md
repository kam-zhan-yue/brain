# Reflection
Decided to try to create daily logs in order to write down the things I did each day and some kind of reflection. Maybe it's beneficial to my mental health? Maybe it's not? I think since this is publicly available, I won't disclose intimate details of my personal life, unless significant. Aiming to keep this relatively work-centric to improve efficiency.

Today was pretty efficient, got some progress on my personal tasks. Hoping to set up a decent project by the start of next year.
