# Reflection
Pretty tough day, felt tired and didn't really do any exercise. Although I started the Chaos Pong project, it seems like such a daunting task that I'm worried about my personal motivation. Nevertheless, I need to push on and follow through with the roadmap, no matter how tough it is, in order to reach my goals for next year.
