# Reflection
Today was a fairly slow day, getting UI tasks done is becoming very fast in my project thanks to the workflows and testing tools I've created. Quite proud of that. I removed the annoying "Skills" portion in my portfolio website and now it looks and feels amazing. I would like to revisit this "Skills" section and do a revamp of my portfolio to make the text more digestible. Perhaps another day.

I also want to begin properly planning my project for 2024, but annoying assembly definitions keep getting in the way. I really want to set up this template with my UI code, but this is just absurd. I need a way to access DOTween Modules without an assembly definition but just an assembly reference. I'll definitely find a way...
