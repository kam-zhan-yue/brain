Lots of time has passed since the last entry. I'm currently in the Chengdu airport waiting to take a transfer flight to Osaka. Life has been progressing pretty well, with significant progress on personal projects, relationships, and career prospects. I'm learning and pushing myself everyday to do better and acquire new skills. Just in the past few months, I've learned React, Typescript, Rust, Node.js, Godot, and Shader Programming. Of course, nothing is entirely fleshed out yet, but I hope to use the rest of the year to keep doing mini-projects to develop these skills even further.

I'm hoping to use Unity and React/Typescript in my career and Godot/Rust in my personal projects. I'm gonna finish this webapp game for the Science Gallery by June and prepare for all my exams in the upcoming week. Things are getting busy, but I'm ready for it.
