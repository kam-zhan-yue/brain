* Did a bunch of shopping and preparing for my move to Kyoto
* Had lunch with an old colleague, learned a lot about animation workflows

# Reflection
Apparently Malaysia suffers from animation brain drain, or generally a lack of good animators. Although it's possible to start a studio and get plenty of work, the talent you hire may not be competent enough to complete said work at an acceptable standard. That's why this guy was hesitant about joining a new animation studio, instead choosing to opt to working on a new game in his current game studio.

Starting a new game really has a lot of benefits. Especially when you've had experienced working on one before. You decide the workflows. You decide the art direction. You decide production. You can take the lessons you've learned from your previous stint and make your new project bigger and better. That's not to say that everything is going to be perfect though. Mistakes will still be made, bad decisions will still occur. It's all about learning from them and being proactive in responding to them that makes it a success.

I was surprised to hear the lack of technical skills in artists at his studio. It seems that because the artists and animators did not fully understand the process of the asset pipeline (in this case, Unity), work was never consistent. There needs to be a "Bible", or standard guidelines in art and animation that is similar to the Coding Standards adopted by a programming team.

Having people that are multi-talented in different fields (e.g. music, art, programming) can greatly contribute to a team's productivity because they not only complete their own tasks, but help to benefit the people around them.
