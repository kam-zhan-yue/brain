Took a break from logging due to being busy so here's just me condensing everything that's happened the past few weeks.

* I optimised the initial loading flow of DGH so that going into the game scene now takes 45% less time (40 to 20 seconds approximately)
* I publicly announced my DGH optimisation plans
* I walked from Sanjo to Marutamachi in the middle of Kamogawa with my friends to catch butcher, and eat a fucking すっぽん
* I participated in the 全日本大会 for Kabbadi. We lost the first round and it was frustrating for my personal performance, but I will never forget the memories I made with my team and the short travels we went on, especially the stays at ライト's house.
* I discovered a new Spanish language podcast for beginners and have been having fun listening to it.
* I participated in a rugby match for the first time in two months. Although we didn't win and I didn't really get the ball (only participated for 20 minutes), it was extremely fun and I made two pretty nice tackles.
* I celebrated 坪井's birthday in my apartment with all my first year rugby friends. We had pizza and maccas and it was nice to have them over for a change.
* I organised the meeting notes and minutes for the upcoming Game Makers' Club meeting.
* I hung out with Alex for the first time in three months. He's been on several trips and is currently seeing a new girl. I wish him the best. One of the most interesting things I learned was that in his time travelling, he actually grew to miss Japan. That was interesting seeing as he originally wanted to leave after realising how much he didn't enjoy life in Kyoto.

It's been a pretty hectic month so far, and I've made tons of memories that I'll cherish for the rest of my life. I think, however, that I've been neglecting the fact that it's still autumn in Kyoto. It's time to make the most of it. I wanna see the 紅葉, explore 嵐山, and visit temples at night to see their light-up illuminations.

It's also been a pretty emotional month, with extreme frustration at the Kabbadi tournament, satisfaction at work, and feeling good about personal relationships and life in general.

I can't wait to do more.
