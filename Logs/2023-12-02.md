Quite some time has passed and its December already. This past week was pretty hectic, I've only had time to myself for a bit as I've been going to rugby training on Monday, Tuesday, and Friday. I had to take a break on Thursday to have some time to clean my apartment. It got too messy for me to handle. I guess it's good sometimes to clean the space where you live.

I've been going to work fairly late this week and I think my managers are not extremely happy about it. It doesn't help that I won't see them for quite a bit when my family come over. I don't know if I can get employed at my current internship, but at the same time, I don't really want to. The pay is too low and coding on their project feels like I'm churning through mud, spending hours just to complete a menial task. I did such a good job speeding up UI development that I can churn out a task in just a day. I even had time to refactor. But now I don't even have time to do the things I want to do, instead I'm setting up and refactoring stupid VR items that don't contribute to the main gameplay loop.

All I'm really learning is how not to run a company and how not to write code. I believe that I'll leave SCS as my very very last option, but it's good to have connections there. I'm sort of worrying about finding a good place, which is why the project(s) I make next year will really matter. I need to amp up my portfolio or make a game that can sustain me for at least 3-4 years in Kyoto. It's risky but it is something that I really want to do. I'll sacrifice my uni life, gym, and wider social circle in Melbourne if it means that I can come back to Kyoto doing what I want to do and being with who 

However, regarding skipping out on work and leaving a semi-bad impression, I think that it is worth it. I wanna spend time with people. I wanna build lasting friendships and relationships. I wanna have more experiences. If this internship doesn't pay me in the first place and management doesn't even interact with me, what's the point of dedicating more time towards there? I'm learning nowadays, but that's only because I'm making an effort to do so. I need to take this effort and redirect it towards myself because I really wanna make a hit game.
