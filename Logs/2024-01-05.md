It has been a really long time since the last log. A lot has also happened since then, personally. My relationship has been tested, I've gone through a lot emotionally, and I've been exposed to a lot of stress from my family. I've ended my internship early, I went to my last rugby practice, and I've spent a lot of time to myself instead of hobbies such as going to the gym or game development. This last month has been one of reflection and discovering more about what it really means to live in Japan and in another country.

Personally, I don't think that I would want to live in Japan unless I had a good reason to. That reason could be a company, a relationship, or something else, but I wouldn't come to Japan just to live in Japan. I love the country, I love the living standards and some unique things that I can't find in other places. However, I also grow tired of the culture, the constant alienation and isolation I feel even though I'm surrounded by friends. Tired of the working culture where no one feels appreciated and Japanese managers refuse to listen and change their ways. 

I'm glad for my girlfriend. She's really helped me through this time and I can't imagine being with anyone else.

I've also been checking properties and setting goals for the year, so I feel productive about that.

Above all, I can't wait for this trip to end so that I have time to do what I want again.
