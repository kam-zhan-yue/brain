I received flowers. Had the best gift of my life. Spent my day with the person I love the most.

It was truly a day to remember.

After so many months, we enjoyed gelato together. Embraced each other for the first time in a month in public. Exchanged flowers and gifts. Talked the night away. Ate gyoza by the bank of Kamogawa. She was so cute.
