# Tasks Completed
* Gave a talk about game development at a community event
* Introduced to [Unity Game Programming Patterns](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/game-programming-patterns-demo "https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/game-programming-patterns-demo") by Jake. Good resource for teaching to UniMelb Game Makers' Club next year for advanced programming
* Created a python script to pull latest itch games and format them nicely. However the markdown doesn't work in GitHub. Shame. Might need to utilise it in my personal website.
* Planning to migrate to Webstorm for future web development
* Planned out the basic gameplay for Chaos Pong

# Reflection
Really tiring day. That game development event was not really about games, at the end of the day. But at the behest of my brother, I had to do something. Getting really excited for Chaos Pong, will definitely start on it tomorrow. Really disappointed about the python script, but hopefully I can turn it into something useful in the future.
