* Go on plenty of dates
* Game observer and addressables

# 2024
An ideal day for me in 2024 would be going to university classes, spending time at the gamer makers' club working on something, going to the gym or part-time job, working on Chaos Pong in my free time, and listening to Spanish / Japanese podcasts and learning tools everyday.

Morning: Part-Time Job, Gym, Podcasts
Afternoon: University Classes, UMGMC, Gym
Evening: Chaos Pong, Podcasts

I'd like to dedicate weekends to Gym, Part-Time Job, Podcasts, and Chaos Pong entirely.

For meals, I'd consist of a rotation between Huel shakes for breakfasts, Huel meals for lunch, and cooked meals for dinner.

For Chaos Pong: Applications close June 18th 2023.

For the first half of the year, I really need to focus in on Chaos Pong
